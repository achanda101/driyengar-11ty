    <h1 class="full-width center">Web Trio Series</h1>
    <p class="full-width">
      The pandemic of 2020 triggered the idea of taking the activities online.
      An impulsive thought gave birth to the trio concept and thus emerged the
      web trio series hosted by ICFA on Instagram. Keeping ICFA’s objective of
      promoting process driven activities in mind, several topics were coined.
      The uniqueness of this series was to present 3 artists share their
      individual journeys concerning a topic or to have one artist speak about
      the topic from 3 different perceptive. The series took to screen between
      13th May and 30th December, and a total of 34 episodes were presented
      live, one on each Wednesday between 7pm and 8pm IST.
    </p>
    <p class="full-width">
      A total of 80 artists have been presented through these series to date.

      Ayurveda, Ariel act, Photography, Gender in dance .. etc.
